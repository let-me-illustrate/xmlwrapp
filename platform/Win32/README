This directory contains the projects for building the library with Microsoft
Visual C++.

Please see comments in libxml.props for configuring the location of the
required XML libraries.

You will need to use Bakefile (http://www.bakefile.org) to regenerate these
projects, but you don't need it to simply use them.


For convience, master.proj msbuild project is included. This downloads all
dependencies. It requires MSBuild.Community.Tasks from
http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/ (just install the MSI package).
